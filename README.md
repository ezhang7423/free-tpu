# free-tpu
omg this is actually insane
### baiscally, tpu = 4gpu, gpu = 60cpu
## and ur getting this for free.
(comparing tflops, https://medium.com/syncedreview/harvard-researchers-benchmark-tpu-gpu-cpu-for-deep-learning-3034a452958d
take this with caveat, because training speed uses more than just raw tflops)

### disclaimer: there has to be some catch as in google probably scrapes all your data, cuz there's no way they would just give this out
